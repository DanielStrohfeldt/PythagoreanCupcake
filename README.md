# Up and Running With GIT
This portion of the README will take you through the steps needed to get going with git.

## Installing Git
Here is a guide to get git installed on your machine.

### Mac OSX users
I recommend getting homebrew if you don't already have this awesome package manager.
To install hombrew run this command in your terminal
	- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Next install git by executing the following command in your terminal.
	- brew install git

If you don't want to install git using brew you can do so with git's osx installer hosted on sourceforge.
	- http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/

### Windows users
Windows users have a simple way of installing git as well.
Visit this page to get your bash terminal, and git tools.
	- https://git-for-windows.github.io/

Hit the download button and follow the install instructions.
Then open up the gitBASH application.

## Beginning Git
Hooray you've painlessly installed git!
